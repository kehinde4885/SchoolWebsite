This Folder contains the FrontEnd Part of the Project

It is broken down into two Folders,
one for the static site and another for the Dashboard which is going to use the React SPA Framework, both are built with Vite

Now Zooming out to the FrontEnd Directory itself,
We installed TailwindCSS here in order to build the tailwindCSS Styles that would be shared between the two folders
The packages helping with building the Styles are
- TailwindCSS

Current Logic
- Build the styles using tailwind CLI


To Run the Build Process for the Tailwind Styles
- Navigate to "Frontend" Directory
- run "npm run generate"
- for automatic building run "npm run genpersist"
